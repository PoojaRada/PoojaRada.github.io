        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Pooja Rada!</h1>
			
			<p>I was born and brought up in India. Being the daughter of an engineer, my interest in engineering was sparked from very early in my childhod. 
			I would often go with my father to his office and observe him and other people work. So, finally when my turn came I choose computer engineering as my major.
			The complexity of algorithms and the challenges of coding is what kept me intrigued. </p>
			
			<p> My lifelong dream is to open up my own IT solutions business. Thus, to fulfill this dream, I choose to purse Post-Baccalaureate Diploma in Technical Management
			and Services from Kwantlen Polytechnic University. This course helped understand the business world better. The importance of Sustainability in business and 
			the laws that would protect me from the bads are some of the major learnings.</p>
